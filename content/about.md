### About me

Hi! I'm Fernando, currently SRE at a startup. I grew up in the 90s, fascinated by the magical machine *beep*. 

### About this website

This blog is a collection of my notes and casual experiments, but it also serves as an incentive for me to keep writing about the things I love and to procrastinate in a [structured way]. 

### Contact

You can find me on [LinkedIn] or send me an email at frn@frn.sh. I would love to chat about systems or simply hear your thoughts on my posts!
