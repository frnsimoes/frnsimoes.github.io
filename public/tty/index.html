<h4 style="text-align: center">Terminal keyboards</h4>
<content> <p><img src="/static/tty/dec.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>My birthday will be next month, so I bought myself something I wanted for a while: a terminal keyboard. Last year I read this <a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/">article</a> about the history of the terminal, and it fascinated me. Well, I found this DEC-style Televideo terminal keyboard from the 70s or 80s (I can&rsquo;t be sure of the exact date), and took advantage of the opportunity to learn a few things.</p>
<p>These old terminal keyboards were sold alongside a &ldquo;computer terminal.&rdquo; A computer terminal was essentially a &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; display and input device. The real computing power was in the mainframe, which was typically placed in another room in the office building. The terminal would send characters to the mainframe and then display the results back to the user. It didn&rsquo;t have its own operating system. The notion of keycodes, scancodes, and other abstractions that we have nowadays didn&rsquo;t exist in the same way.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened when you used a terminal keyboard: when you pressed a key, let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;A&rdquo;, the keyboard generated a specific electrical signal. The terminal would interpret this signal, convert it to ASCII or another character encoding, and transmit it to the mainframe using a protocol like RS-232. The mainframe would process this input according to whatever program was running, and send results back to the terminal for display.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[KEYBOARD/TERMINAL] &lt;--wire--&gt; [MAINFRAME]
        ASCII                       ASCII
     (01000001)                 &#34;This is &#39;A&#39;&#34;
</code></pre><p>Or, in a more detailed way:</p>
<p><img src="/static/tty/term-diagram.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Modern keyboards don&rsquo;t work like this. They don&rsquo;t mess with bytes and ASCII directly. Instead, they just send a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scancode">scancode</a>, which is basically just a code saying which key you pressed. Your computer&rsquo;s OS figures out what to do with it using the USB HID protocol, which is pretty complex but gives us all those nice features like different layouts and function keys.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about these old terminal keyboards is how wildly different their connections were. It wasn&rsquo;t like today where everything is just USB. Every company was doing their own thing with serial connections back then.</p>
<p>Computer terminals had differentes between themselves, both from physical and encoding perspectives.</p>
<p>DEC had their weird modified RS-232 with custom connectors. IBM did their own proprietary stuff. Wyse, Televideo, and others all had their own setups. Even when they used the same-looking connectors like DB-25 or DB-9, they&rsquo;d wire them up differently just to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>The way they encoded text was could vary too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular <a href="https://www.ascii-code.com/ASCII">7-bit ASCII</a> (128 characters)</li>
<li>Various [8-bit extended ASCII versions)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII) (IBM had CP437, DEC had their Multinational thing)</li>
<li>IBM even made their own system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s why some companies like Televideo started making keyboards that could switch between different modes. They put some DIP switches on them that you could flip and pretend to be different terminals.</p>
<p>One thing that I truly find fascinating is how modern terminals inherited from those old computer terminals.</p>
<p>When you open Terminal on a Mac or Linux, you&rsquo;re using a terminal emulator (tmux, wezzterm, etc), software pretending to be those old physical terminals. The &ldquo;Terminal&rdquo; part of the name isn&rsquo;t there without reason, it&rsquo;s literally emulating what those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">DEC VT100s</a> and Televideo terminals used to do in hardware.</p>
<p>The legacy shows up everywhere once you know what to look for. Take the TERM environment variable - it often defaults to &ldquo;xterm&rdquo; or something like &ldquo;xterm-256color.&rdquo; That &ldquo;xterm&rdquo; refers to the X Window System Terminal, which itself was emulating capabilities of hardware terminals (I guess?). it looks like the terminal is essentially emulating the emulator.</p>
<p>We have a bunch of legacy things in our own setups. Example, my <code>TERM</code> environment variable is <code>xterm-256color</code> (cool discuttion about this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10003136/what-is-the-difference-between-xterm-color-xterm-256color">here</a>).</p>
<p>Classic terminals were often limited to <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width">80 columns</a> by 24 or 25 rows, and many modern terminal defaults still reflect this. It&rsquo;s why terminal text still wraps at 80 characters in many configurations. (Check out how&rsquo;s yours configured: <code>stty size</code>)</p>
<p>Finally, and I already wrote a little bit about this, we have the <code>tty</code> command. This command is really interesting because different programs use this command to check if the input/output is a &ldquo;real terminal&rdquo; instead of something else (could be a pipe, for example). So the modern notion of a &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; still has ties to the old computer terminals (and I&rsquo;m not even mentioning teletype writers).</p>
